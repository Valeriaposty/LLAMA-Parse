       "'The State of the Union Address (sometimes abbreviated to SOTU) is an annual message delivered by the president of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress near the beginning of most calendar years on the current condition of the nation.[3][4] The State of the Union Address generally includes reports on the nation\\'s budget, economy, news, agenda, progress, achievements and the president\\'s priorities and legislative proposals.[5]\\n\\nThe address fulfills the requirement in Article II, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution for the president to periodically \"give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"[3] During most of the country\\'s first century, the president primarily submitted only a written report to Congress. After 1913, Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. president, began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for the president\\'s agenda, while also submitting a more detailed report.[3] With the advent of radio and television, the address is now broadcast live in all United States time zones on many networks.[6]\\n\\nThe speech is generally held in January or February, and an invitation to the president is extended to use the chamber of the House by the speaker of the House. Starting in 1981, Ronald Reagan, the 40th U.S. president, began the practice of newly inaugurated presidents delivering an address to Congress in the first year of their term but not designating that speech an official \"State of the Union\".[7]\\n\\nRepresentation In The State Of The Union Addresses\\nState of the Union Addresses serve as a critical platform for political leaders to address the nation, shaping perceptions and policies on issues of paramount importance. Analyzing such addresses reveals the intricate dynamics of representation in American politics. A study elucidates how gender intersects with political allegiance, indicating a Democratic party inclination towards women\\'s interests, especially liberal ones.[8] Meanwhile, the prevalence of color blindness rhetoric, emphasizing individuality over systemic racism, catering to a predominantly white populace[9]. There are deeply entrenched gender norms, spotlighting the masculine aura surrounding the presidential office[10]. Notably, Rotramel (2016) underscores the transformative power of inclusive language, as exemplified by President Obama\\'s historic acknowledgment of LGBT rights in a State of the Union address[11]. Metaphorical framing elucidate how political leaders strategically shape perceptions, invoking moral imperatives to garner support.[12] These citations collectively underscore the multifaceted nature of representation in State of the Union Addresses, encapsulating the complexities of gender, race, and rhetoric in American politics.\\n\\nFormality\\nThe practice arises from a duty of the president under the State of the Union Clause of the U.S. Constitution:[13]\\n\\nHe shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\n\\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution\\nThough the language of the clause is not specific, since the 1930s, the president has made this report annually in late January or early February. Between 1934 and 2024 the date has been as early as January 3,[7] and as late as March 7.\\n\\nWhile not required to deliver a speech, every president since Woodrow Wilson, with the notable exception of Herbert Hoover,[2] has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before then, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report.[7]\\n\\nSince Franklin Roosevelt, the State of the Union is given typically each January before a joint session of the United States Congress and is held in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol. Newly inaugurated presidents generally deliver an address to Congress in February of the first year of their term, but this speech is not officially considered to be a \"State of the Union\".[7]\\n\\nWhat began as a communication between president and Congress has become in effect a communication between the president and the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live in all United States time zones on most networks, preempting scheduled programming. Since at least the 1960s, in order to reach the largest audience, the speech has typically been given at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time, UTC-5).[14]'"
