As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value. No material unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses were recorded as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining maturity of debt securities was less than one year as of June 30, 2023.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



## Fair Value Hierarchy



We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:



- Level 1: Valuations based on quoted market prices of identical underlying securities.

- Level 2: Valuations obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable or identical instruments.

- Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs and estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices and lack of liquidity.



As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, redeemable preferred stock investments, and convertible secured notes in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.



Realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities are determined using a specific identification method.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.





We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $77 million and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $65 million and $120 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Zomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets and foreign tax rate differences.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, of which approximately $29 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $48 million of unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.





Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 30, 2023 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.







Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.



We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

## Non-Income Tax Matters



An estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters is recorded. Uber is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to Drivers and Couriers. The estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.

## Indemnifications



In the ordinary course of business, Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in arrangements with third parties. The maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions cannot be determined due to unique facts and circumstances in each situation.



## Variable Interest Entities



Variable interest entities ("VIEs") are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support. Uber consolidates VIEs in which it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.



### Uber Freight Holding Corporation

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.



## Overview



Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a vast network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also developing technologies to address everyday problems.



## Driver Classification Developments



Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. There are disputes over whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. In California, there have been legal actions and regulatory developments impacting driver classification, including Proposition 22. Compliance with these regulations may lead to additional expenses for Uber, but the company does not anticipate a material impact on its business operations.



If Uber is required to classify drivers as employees, it could result in significant additional expenses related to compensating drivers, applying labor laws, providing benefits, and paying taxes. This could also affect driver supply and impact Uber's business and financial performance negatively.

### Highlights for the Second Quarter 2023



In the second quarter of 2023, our MAPCs were 137 million, growing 7 million, or 5%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 12% compared to the same period in 2022. Overall Gross Bookings increased to $33.6 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up 16% or 18% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2022. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 28% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to increases in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders. Freight Gross Bookings declined 31% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to macroeconomic headwinds impacting the broader freight industry.



Revenue was $9.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 18%, on a constant currency basis. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes.



Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $394 million, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net of $386 million primarily related to a $466 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment; a $225 million unrealized gain on our Grab investment; and a $151 million unrealized gain on our Joby investment, partially offset by a $461 million unrealized loss on our Didi investment. Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $504 million of stock-based compensation expense.

## Components of Results of Operations



### Revenue



We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. Revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants for various services. In certain markets, revenue is presented on a gross basis. Revenue may fluctuate based on various factors.



For more details on revenue, refer to the financial statements in the Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



### Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization



Cost of revenue includes insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, and costs related to services provided by Drivers and Couriers. Costs may fluctuate based on platform activity.



### Operations and Support



Expenses include compensation for employees supporting operations, customer support, and corporate costs. Expenses are expected to increase as the business grows.



### Sales and Marketing



Expenses consist of compensation costs, advertising, promotions, and discounts. Expenses may vary based on marketing campaigns and business model changes.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



# Research and Development



Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.



We would expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.



# General and Administrative



General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.



We would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.



# Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.



# Interest Expense





# Other Income (Expense), Net



Other income (expense), net primarily includes various items such as interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, impairment of equity method investment, loss from sale of investment, revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, and other miscellaneous items.



# Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes



Uber is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it does business. The company maintains a valuation allowance against a majority of its deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until there is sufficient evidence to support the future utilization of these assets. The effective tax rate will vary depending on various factors including foreign to domestic income proportion, changes in valuation allowance, and tax laws.



Based on current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that Uber will have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 18 months, although the exact timing and amount of any release is unknown at this time.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

### Analysis



Adjusted EBITDA profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $916 million, showing a significant improvement of 152% from $364 million in the same period in 2022. This improvement was mainly driven by increases in Mobility and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profits, partially offset by higher Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.



For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.7 billion, marking a substantial improvement of 215% from $532 million in the same period in 2022. The improvement was primarily due to a significant increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit.

## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

## Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $237 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which includes: $974 million of stock-based compensation expense; $415 million depreciation and amortization expense; $78 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets; and a $74 million loss from sale of investment, partially offset by $706 million in unrealized gains from equity securities. In addition, cash consumed by working capital decreased by $609 million. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.



Net cash provided by operating activities was $454 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $8.5 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $7.2 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $829 million of stock-based compensation expense and $497 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $631 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other accrued insurance reserves.



## Investing Activities



Net cash provided by investing activities was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.6 billion and $703 million proceeds from the sale of an equity method investment, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $2.2 billion, and $107 million in purchases of property and equipment.



Net cash used in investing activities was $189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $119 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.



## Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities was $65 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $82 million of principal payments of finance leases and a $16 million net cash outflow related to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, comprised of (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The total outflow was offset by $85 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Net cash used in financing activities was $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $108 million of principal payments on finance leases.

## Non-Income Tax Matters





## Commitments



Uber has non-cancelable commitments primarily related to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2023, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Uber's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, requiring the company to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates, impacting future financial statements.



## Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Refer to Note 1 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on recent accounting pronouncements.



## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



Uber is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk primarily relates to the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, with fluctuations impacting financial statements. Investment risk is managed through limiting credit exposure and maintaining high credit quality in cash deposits. Uber's investment policy aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Uber does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on Uber's financial results.



Uber is exposed to risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. Uber holds privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. Uber also holds equity securities with readily determinable fair values subject to equity price risk. These investments may increase the volatility in Uber's net income in future periods due to changes in fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of Uber's investments was $7.0 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.



## Foreign Currency Risk



Uber transacts business globally in multiple currencies. International revenue, costs, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose Uber to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect Uber's future revenue and operating results expressed in U.S. dollars. Uber's foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and expenses are incurred in the same currencies in those regions.



Uber has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities. Uber may consider entering into derivatives or other financial instruments in the future to hedge foreign currency exchange risk.



## Controls and Procedures



### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Uber maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. Management evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they are effective at a reasonable assurance level.



### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes to Uber's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect internal control over financial reporting.



Uber's management believes that disclosure controls, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives but may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud.



## Legal Proceedings



Uber is a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar actions could be brought against Uber in the future. The most significant matters are described in detail in the report.

Australia Class Actions



In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. A trial has been scheduled to commence in March 2024.



Other Legal Proceedings



While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.



## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS





### Risk Factor Summary



The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.



- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

# Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business



## Operational Risks





In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $535 million as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.

This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



## Legal Challenges and Impact on Business Model



If Uber is required to classify Drivers as employees, it would result in significant additional expenses and potential changes to the business model. This could lead to price increases for Riders and impact Driver supply and overall business operations.



### Examples of Judicial Decisions



Various judicial decisions in different countries have addressed the classification of Drivers, potentially leading to reclassification and unionization, which could further impact Uber's operations and financial condition.



## Competition in Mobility, Delivery, and Logistics Industries



The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry. Uber faces competition globally and must compete effectively to maintain its business and financial prospects.



### Global Competition and Market Fragmentation



Uber competes globally in fragmented markets with low switching costs. Competition comes from existing alternatives and potential new entrants, posing challenges to Uber's market position and differentiation.



### Impact of Competition on Offerings



Competition affects Uber's offerings in mobility, delivery, and logistics, with a focus on personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, and evolving consumer preferences. Increased competition may impact revenue, user base, and product differentiation.

The markets in which Uber competes have attracted significant investments from various sources, leading to well-capitalized competitors. This may result in competitive pressures such as price reductions, driver incentives, and promotions that could impact Uber's market position.



Uber has incurred substantial losses since inception, with operating losses of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $32.5 billion. The company anticipates the need to increase revenue and decrease expenses to achieve profitability.



Uber's future profitability is uncertain due to the need for increased revenue, cost management, and investments in various areas such as expanding markets, research and development, and marketing. The company faces challenges in balancing revenue generation with cost containment.



Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, and carrier attraction and retention are crucial for Uber's platform success. The company's ability to scale its network and liquidity in geographic markets depends on attracting and retaining these platform users.



Uber may face challenges in maintaining a balance between supply and demand in different markets, impacting service quality and overall operational effectiveness.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Below is a continuation of the content:



...



Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.



The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.



Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.



In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.



...

---

# Uber Quarterly Report



# Uber Quarterly Report



We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.



We recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.



Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.



While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.



Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.





Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful.



Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.



Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.



As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,200.

Global employees as of June 30, 2023, totaled approximately 22,000, with around 19,100 located outside the United States. The company's international workforce has been growing as part of its global expansion efforts.



Properly managing growth involves hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees across various functions such as engineering, operations, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing. Any challenges in these areas could harm the business.



Implementing workforce reductions and restructurings, including responses to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, may have unintended consequences and costs. Maintaining consistent policies across regions and functions is crucial for effective management.



Failure to upgrade technology and network infrastructure could lead to system disruptions and poor user experiences. Significant resources are required to support operational growth, improve technology, and enhance financial and management systems.



The complex organizational structure of Uber, with its diverse user base and global expansion, necessitates continuous improvement in operational, financial, and management controls. Inadequate management of growth could impact platform quality and competitiveness.



Concerns about safety incidents involving platform users could affect the company's ability to attract and retain drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, impacting reputation and financial performance.



The company faces challenges in controlling and predicting user actions that may result in safety incidents, property damage, or legal liabilities. Qualification processes and background checks for platform users are important but may not uncover all relevant information.



Instances of criminal activity or misconduct by drivers, carriers, or platform users can harm the company's brand and reputation. Negative press coverage related to such incidents may impact consumer trust and business relationships.

Below is an excerpt from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):



...



Consumers in certain regions, such as Latin America, have been facing safety concerns while using or providing services on the Uber platform. Reports of violent crimes including armed robbery, assault, and rape have been increasing. These incidents not only pose risks to individuals but also impact Uber's ability to attract and retain users, potentially affecting the company's financial performance.



Public disclosure of safety incidents related to the platform, whether by Uber or third parties, could further harm the company's business and financial results.



Uber may face significant liability claims arising from accidents, injuries, or other incidents involving drivers, consumers, or third parties using the platform. Operating motor vehicles and expanding services like Delivery to include couriers on two-wheel vehicles introduce additional risks and potential liabilities.



The company's investments in new technologies and offerings, such as online grocery and alcohol delivery, carry inherent risks. While these ventures aim to drive growth, there is no guarantee of realizing expected benefits.



Uber's international operations, which account for a significant portion of its business, present challenges due to limited experience in certain markets. Managing risks associated with global expansion is crucial for the company's financial performance and future prospects.

We do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:



- Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

- The resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation

of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;

- Laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet

activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,

payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and

background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,

ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;

- Competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing

relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;

- Differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;

- Differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;

- Exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;

- Legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a

lack of clear legal precedent;

- Difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor

unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;

- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

- Managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;

- Regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the

same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;

- Adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of

earnings;

- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;

- Difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and

jurisdictions;

- Import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;

- Political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in

general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;

- Public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to

time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate;

- Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.



These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.



We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.



Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with

and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy

has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our

competitors in those lines of businesses.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.



We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:



- grow supply and demand on our platform;

- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;

- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;

- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;

- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;

- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;

- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;

- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;

- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;

- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and

- increase positive perception of our brand.



We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability.



We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.





Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s business, financial condition, and operating results for a specific quarter.



In 2022, Uber generated 15% of its Mobility Gross Bookings from trips related to airports, making its operating results susceptible to regulations impacting drivers' ability to provide airport trips.



Concerns include declines in air travel affecting demand for airport-related Mobility, regulatory challenges at airports, and potential fines or sanctions for non-compliance.



Uber's investment in autonomous vehicle technologies is crucial for future competitiveness. Collaborations with companies like Aurora aim to launch self-driving vehicles on the ridesharing network.



Risks associated with autonomous vehicle technologies include collisions, liabilities, regulatory challenges, and competition from other companies developing similar technologies.



Uber's success also relies on retaining high-quality personnel, with attrition or unsuccessful succession planning posing risks to the business.

Competitor Challenges and Workplace Practices:



Uber faces challenges related to historical culture, workplace practices, and negative publicity leading to significant attrition and difficulty in attracting high-quality employees. The shift to a hybrid work model may pose challenges in maintaining corporate culture, productivity, and employee availability.



Leadership Transitions and Management Changes:



Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt Uber's business, potentially leading to senior management turnover. Failure to have adequate succession plans or key employees transitioning into new roles could harm operating results and growth.



Key Personnel and Talent Retention:



Uber relies on key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The loss of key executives or failure to attract high-quality talent could impact operating results. Equity incentives are used to attract and retain personnel, but may not always align with business interests.



Data Security and Privacy:



Uber collects and processes personal data, making it a target for security breaches. Unauthorized access to data could result in revenue loss, brand harm, and liabilities. Third-party service providers hosting data may also experience security incidents, impacting Uber.



Security Breaches and Liability:



Uber faces risks of security breaches, computer viruses, and cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, damage business, and lead to liabilities. Compliance with laws and regulations, litigation, and governmental investigations are additional concerns.



Previous Incidents:



Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as a cybersecurity incident in September 2022 and a data security incident in May 2014, highlighting the ongoing risks the company faces.

Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.



We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks. Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.



To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.



Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.



We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational

In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.





Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

## Climate Change Risks



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks. These risks involve market shifts towards electric vehicles, extreme weather events, and emerging climate policies.



Uber has made climate-related commitments such as transitioning to 100% renewable electricity for U.S. offices by 2025 and achieving net zero climate emissions by 2030.



External factors like changing regulations, technology advancements, and EV availability impact Uber's ability to meet its climate commitments.



## General Economic Risks



Uber acknowledges the impact of catastrophic events like disease outbreaks, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks on its business and financial condition.



The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected Uber's operations, leading to reduced demand for mobility offerings and impacting driver supply constraints.



Future impacts of pandemics or disease outbreaks on Uber's business will depend on various factors including vaccine efficacy, global developments, and regulatory orders.

# Dependencies on Third Parties



The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.



## Internet and Mobile Infrastructure



Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals, or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide necessary bandwidth, can interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. This may lead to decreased user engagement and potential revenue loss.



## Mobile Communications Systems



Unanticipated problems like power outages, security breaches, or telecommunications failures can cause delays or interruptions to our products and offerings. Government actions to shut down services could also impact our operations and reputation.



## Third-Party Marketplaces and Software



We rely on open marketplaces like the Apple App Store and Google Play for distributing our platform and using essential software like Google Maps. Changes in marketplace structures or fees, or disruptions in software access, could adversely affect our business.



## Interoperability



Our platform's interoperability across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications is crucial. Loss of interoperability could have negative implications for our business, especially if we cannot adapt to evolving third-party services.



## Payment Processing Infrastructure



Third-party elements in our payment processing infrastructure are essential for remitting payments to drivers and merchants. If these elements become unavailable or come with unfavorable terms, our business could face disruptions and increased costs.

## Risks and Challenges



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces several risks and challenges that could impact its business operations:



### Increased Costs and System Failures



The company may experience increased costs due to rising fees, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. System failures have also caused payment delays to drivers, leading to dissatisfaction and complaints.



### Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers



Uber relies on third-party service providers for hosting its platform. Any interruptions or delays in services from these providers could harm the delivery of products and offerings.



### Data Security and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities



The company uses a combination of cloud computing services and data centers, which may be vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters, or other disruptions. Any data loss or interruption in services could impact the company's reputation and brand.



### Open Source Software Risks



Uber's use of third-party open source software exposes it to possible litigation and compliance challenges. Non-compliance with open source licenses could result in the release of proprietary source code or the need for software re-engineering.



These risks and challenges highlight the potential impact on Uber's business operations and financial performance.

Source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.



## Financing and Transactional Risks



We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.



We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As of June 30, 2023, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.3 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $153 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of June 30, 2023. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations. In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed

to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters

to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play

payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.



Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for

valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.





We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.



Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.



If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.



As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.

Uber operates in approximately 10,500 cities across 70 countries, subject to differing laws and regulations. Proposed regulations may harm business operations and financial results.



## Impact of Laws and Regulations



New laws and regulations could lead to liability, compliance costs, and restrictions on Uber's operations. Expansion into new areas like medical transportation may bring additional regulatory challenges.

- Regulators in the UK, Netherlands, and France imposed fines of approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 data breach.

- In 2022, Uber faced a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ over the handling of the 2016 data breach.

- Uber is also under scrutiny for transactions in the US and other countries, which could lead to additional fines and penalties.

- Uber faces risks related to data processing, potentially resulting in investigations, litigation, fines, and negative publicity.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.



Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.



We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.



Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.





In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.



We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.



In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business

Customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.



We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.



If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Intellectual Property Risks



Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, divert management's attention and resources, and harm goodwill associated with our brand. Adverse outcomes may lead to significant liability, cessation of technology use, and hindered competitiveness.



# Financial Reporting Risks



Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our reported financial results. Evolving business models, regulations, and interpretations could impact revenue recognition, leading to material changes in financial statements and reporting processes.



# Investment Company Act Compliance



If deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may face restrictions affecting our business. Compliance requirements and limitations on activities could impact our financial condition and operations, necessitating asset sales and tax payments.



# Common Stock Ownership Risks



The market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline steeply, irrespective of operating performance. Factors beyond our control, such as financial results, analyst expectations, and industry announcements, can significantly influence stock price.

Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products. Additionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value. No material unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses were recorded as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining maturity of debt securities was less than one year as of June 30, 2023.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



## Fair Value Hierarchy



We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:



- Level 1: Valuations based on quoted market prices of identical underlying securities.

- Level 2: Valuations obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable or identical instruments.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.





We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $77 million and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $65 million and $120 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Zomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets and foreign tax rate differences.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, of which approximately $29 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $48 million of unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.





Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 30, 2023 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.







Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.



We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

Our segment operating performance measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

## Non-Income Tax Matters



An estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters is recorded. Uber is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to Drivers and Couriers. The estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.



## Overview



Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a vast network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also developing technologies to address everyday problems.



## Driver Classification Developments



Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. There are disputes over whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. In California, there have been legal actions and regulatory developments impacting driver classification, including Proposition 22. Compliance with these regulations may lead to additional expenses for Uber, but the company does not anticipate a material impact on its business operations.



If Uber is required to classify drivers as employees, it could result in significant additional expenses related to compensating drivers, applying labor laws, providing benefits, and paying taxes. This could also affect driver supply and impact Uber's business and financial performance negatively.

### Highlights for the Second Quarter 2023



In the second quarter of 2023, our MAPCs were 137 million, growing 7 million, or 5%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 12% compared to the same period in 2022. Overall Gross Bookings increased to $33.6 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up 16% or 18% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2022. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 28% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to increases in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders. Freight Gross Bookings declined 31% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to macroeconomic headwinds impacting the broader freight industry.



Revenue was $9.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 18%, on a constant currency basis. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes.



Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $394 million, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net of $386 million primarily related to a $466 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment; a $225 million unrealized gain on our Grab investment; and a $151 million unrealized gain on our Joby investment, partially offset by a $461 million unrealized loss on our Didi investment.

## Components of Results of Operations



### Revenue



We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. Revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants for various services. In certain markets, revenue is presented on a gross basis. Revenue may fluctuate based on various factors.



For more details on revenue, refer to the financial statements in the Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



### Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization



Cost of revenue includes insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, and costs related to services provided by Drivers and Couriers. Costs may fluctuate based on platform activity.



### Operations and Support



Expenses include compensation for employees supporting operations, customer support, and corporate costs. Expenses are expected to increase as the business grows.



### Sales and Marketing



Expenses consist of compensation costs, advertising, promotions, and discounts. Expenses may vary based on marketing campaigns and business model changes.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



# Research and Development



Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.



We would expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.



# General and Administrative



General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.



We would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.



# Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.



# Interest Expense





# Other Income (Expense), Net



Other income (expense), net primarily includes various items such as interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, impairment of equity method investment, loss from sale of investment, revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, and other miscellaneous items.



# Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes



Uber is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it does business. The company maintains a valuation allowance against a majority of its deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until there is sufficient evidence to support the future utilization of these assets. The effective tax rate will vary depending on various factors including foreign to domestic income proportion, changes in valuation allowance, and tax laws.



Based on current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that Uber will have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 18 months, although the exact timing and amount of any release is unknown at this time.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

### Analysis



Adjusted EBITDA profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $916 million, showing a significant improvement of 152% from $364 million in the same period in 2022. This improvement was mainly driven by increases in Mobility and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profits, partially offset by higher Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.



For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.7 billion, marking a substantial improvement of 215% from $532 million in the same period in 2022. The improvement was primarily due to a significant increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit.

## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

## Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $237 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which includes: $974 million of stock-based compensation expense; $415 million depreciation and amortization expense; $78 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets; and a $74 million loss from sale of investment, partially offset by $706 million in unrealized gains from equity securities. In addition, cash consumed by working capital decreased by $609 million. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.



Net cash provided by operating activities was $454 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $8.5 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $7.2 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $829 million of stock-based compensation expense and $497 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $631 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other accrued insurance reserves.



## Investing Activities



Net cash provided by investing activities was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.6 billion and $703 million proceeds from the sale of an equity method investment, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $2.2 billion, and $107 million in purchases of property and equipment.



Net cash used in investing activities was $189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $119 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.



## Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities was $65 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $82 million of principal payments of finance leases and a $16 million net cash outflow related to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, comprised of (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The total outflow was offset by $85 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Net cash used in financing activities was $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $108 million of principal payments on finance leases.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



## Non-Income Tax Matters





## Commitments



Uber has non-cancelable commitments primarily related to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2023, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Uber's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, requiring the company to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates, impacting future financial statements.



## Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Refer to Note 1 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on recent accounting pronouncements.



## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



Uber is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk primarily relates to the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, with fluctuations impacting financial statements. Investment risk is managed through limiting credit exposure and maintaining high credit quality in cash deposits. Uber's investment policy aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Uber does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on Uber's financial results.



Uber is exposed to risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. Uber holds privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. Uber also holds equity securities with readily determinable fair values subject to equity price risk. These investments may increase the volatility in Uber's net income in future periods due to changes in fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of Uber's investments was $7.0 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.



## Foreign Currency Risk



Uber transacts business globally in multiple currencies. International revenue, costs, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose Uber to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect Uber's future revenue and operating results expressed in U.S. dollars. Uber's foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and expenses are incurred in the same currencies in those regions.



Uber has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities. Uber may consider entering into derivatives or other financial instruments in the future to hedge foreign currency exchange risk.



## Controls and Procedures



### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Uber maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. Management evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they are effective at a reasonable assurance level.



### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes to Uber's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect internal control over financial reporting.



Uber's management believes that disclosure controls, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives but may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud.



## Legal Proceedings



Uber is a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar actions could be brought against Uber in the future. The most significant matters are described in detail in the report.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. A trial has been scheduled to commence in March 2024.



Other Legal Proceedings



While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.



## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS





### Risk Factor Summary



The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.



- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

# Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business



## Operational Risks





In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $535 million as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Below is a continuation of the content:



...



Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.



The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.



Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.



In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.



...

# Uber Quarterly Report



# Uber Quarterly Report



We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.



We recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.



Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.



While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.



Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.





Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful.



Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.



Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.



As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,200.

Global employees as of June 30, 2023, totaled approximately 22,000, with around 19,100 located outside the United States. The company's international workforce has been growing as part of its global expansion efforts.



Properly managing growth involves hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees across various functions such as engineering, operations, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing. Any challenges in these areas could harm the business.



Implementing workforce reductions and restructurings, including responses to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, may have unintended consequences and costs. Maintaining consistent policies across regions and functions is crucial for effective management.



Failure to upgrade technology and network infrastructure could lead to system disruptions and poor user experiences. Significant resources are required to support operational growth, improve technology, and enhance financial and management systems.



The complex organizational structure of Uber, with its diverse user base and global expansion, necessitates continuous improvement in operational, financial, and management controls. Inadequate management of growth could impact platform quality and competitiveness.



Concerns about safety incidents involving platform users could affect the company's ability to attract and retain drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, impacting reputation and financial performance.



The company faces challenges in controlling and predicting user actions that may result in safety incidents, property damage, or legal liabilities. Qualification processes and background checks for platform users are important but may not uncover all relevant information.



Instances of criminal activity or misconduct by drivers, carriers, or platform users can harm the company's brand and reputation. Negative press coverage related to such incidents may impact consumer trust and business relationships.

Consumers in certain regions, such as Latin America, have been facing safety concerns while using or providing services on the Uber platform. Reports of violent crimes including armed robbery, assault, and rape have been increasing. These incidents not only pose risks to individuals but also impact Uber's ability to attract and retain users, potentially affecting the company's financial performance.



Public disclosure of safety incidents related to the platform, whether by Uber or third parties, could further harm the company's business and financial results.



Uber may face significant liability claims arising from accidents, injuries, or other incidents involving drivers, consumers, or third parties using the platform. Operating motor vehicles and expanding services like Delivery to include couriers on two-wheel vehicles introduce additional risks and potential liabilities.



The company's investments in new technologies and offerings, such as online grocery and alcohol delivery, carry inherent risks. While these ventures aim to drive growth, there is no guarantee of realizing expected benefits.



Uber's international operations, which account for a significant portion of its business, present challenges due to limited experience in certain markets. Managing risks associated with global expansion is crucial for the company's financial performance and future prospects.

We do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:



- Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

- The resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation

of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;

- Laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet

activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,

payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and

background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,

ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;

- Competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing

relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;

- Differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;

- Differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;

- Exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;

- Legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a

lack of clear legal precedent;

- Difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor

unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;

- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

- Managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;

- Regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the

same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;

- Adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of

earnings;

- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;

- Difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and

jurisdictions;

- Import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;

- Political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in

general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;

- Public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to

time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate;

- Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.



These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.



We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.



Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with

and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy

has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our

competitors in those lines of businesses.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.



We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:



- grow supply and demand on our platform;

- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;

- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;

- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;

- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;

- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;

- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;

- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;

- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;

- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and

- increase positive perception of our brand.



We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability.



We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.





Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s business, financial condition, and operating results for a specific quarter.



In 2022, Uber generated 15% of its Mobility Gross Bookings from trips related to airports, making its operating results susceptible to regulations impacting drivers' ability to provide airport trips.



Concerns include declines in air travel affecting demand for airport-related Mobility, regulatory challenges at airports, and potential fines or sanctions for non-compliance.



Uber's investment in autonomous vehicle technologies is crucial for future competitiveness. Collaborations with companies like Aurora aim to launch self-driving vehicles on the ridesharing network.



Risks associated with autonomous vehicle technologies include collisions, liabilities, regulatory challenges, and competition from other companies developing similar technologies.



Uber's success also relies on retaining high-quality personnel, with attrition or unsuccessful succession planning posing risks to the business.

Competitor Challenges and Workplace Practices:



Uber faces challenges related to historical culture, workplace practices, and negative publicity leading to significant attrition and difficulty in attracting high-quality employees. The shift to a hybrid work model may pose challenges in maintaining corporate culture, productivity, and employee availability.



Leadership Transitions and Management Changes:



Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt Uber's business, potentially leading to senior management turnover. Failure to have adequate succession plans or key employees transitioning into new roles could harm operating results and growth.



Key Personnel and Talent Retention:



Uber relies on key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The loss of key executives or failure to attract high-quality talent could impact operating results. Equity incentives are used to attract and retain personnel, but may not always align with business interests.



Data Security and Privacy:



Uber collects and processes personal data, making it a target for security breaches. Unauthorized access to data could result in revenue loss, brand harm, and liabilities. Third-party service providers hosting data may also experience security incidents, impacting Uber.



Security Breaches and Liability:



Uber faces risks of security breaches, computer viruses, and cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, damage business, and lead to liabilities. Compliance with laws and regulations, litigation, and governmental investigations are additional concerns.



Previous Incidents:



Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as a cybersecurity incident in September 2022 and a data security incident in May 2014, highlighting the ongoing risks the company faces.

Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.



We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks. Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.



To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.



Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.



We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational

In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.





Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

# Dependencies on Third Parties



The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.



## Internet and Mobile Infrastructure



Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals, or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide necessary bandwidth, can interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. This may lead to decreased user engagement and potential revenue loss.



## Mobile Communications Systems



Unanticipated problems like power outages, security breaches, or telecommunications failures can cause delays or interruptions to our products and offerings. Government actions to shut down services could also impact our operations and reputation.



## Third-Party Marketplaces and Software



We rely on open marketplaces like the Apple App Store and Google Play for distributing our platform and using essential software like Google Maps. Changes in marketplace structures or fees, or disruptions in software access, could adversely affect our business.



## Interoperability



Our platform's interoperability across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications is crucial. Loss of interoperability could have negative implications for our business, especially if we cannot adapt to evolving third-party services.



## Payment Processing Infrastructure



Third-party elements in our payment processing infrastructure are essential for remitting payments to drivers and merchants. If these elements become unavailable or come with unfavorable terms, our business could face disruptions and increased costs.

## Risks and Challenges



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces several risks and challenges that could impact its business operations:



### Increased Costs and System Failures



The company may experience increased costs due to rising fees, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. System failures have also caused payment delays to drivers, leading to dissatisfaction and complaints.



### Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers



Uber relies on third-party service providers for hosting its platform. Any interruptions or delays in services from these providers could harm the delivery of products and offerings.



### Data Security and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities



The company uses a combination of cloud computing services and data centers, which may be vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters, or other disruptions. Any data loss or interruption in services could impact the company's reputation and brand.



### Open Source Software Risks



Uber's use of third-party open source software exposes it to possible litigation and compliance challenges. Non-compliance with open source licenses could result in the release of proprietary source code or the need for software re-engineering.



These risks and challenges highlight the potential impact on Uber's business operations and financial performance.

Source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.



## Financing and Transactional Risks



We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.



We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As of June 30, 2023, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.3 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $153 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of June 30, 2023. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations. In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed

to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters

to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play

payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.



Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for

valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.



Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.



If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.



As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.



Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.



We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.



Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.





In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.



We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.



In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business

Customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.



We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.



If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

# Intellectual Property Risks



Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, divert management's attention and resources, and harm goodwill associated with our brand. Adverse outcomes may lead to significant liability, cessation of technology use, and hindered competitiveness.



# Financial Reporting Risks



Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our reported financial results. Evolving business models, regulations, and interpretations could impact revenue recognition, leading to material changes in financial statements and reporting processes.



# Investment Company Act Compliance



If deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may face restrictions affecting our business. Compliance requirements and limitations on activities could impact our financial condition and operations, necessitating asset sales and tax payments.



# Common Stock Ownership Risks



The market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline steeply, irrespective of operating performance. Factors beyond our control, such as financial results, analyst expectations, and industry announcements, can significantly influence stock price.

# Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer



Actual events or results may differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. As such, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strategy, and financial needs. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.



In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.



The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information, actual results, revised expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements



### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Unaudited)



Description of Business:



Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform. Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (“Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.



Geographical Presence:



Uber's technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).



Pending Careem Super App Investment:



In April 2023, Uber entered into agreements with Emirates Telecommunication Group Company (“e&”) for a majority equity interest in the Careem non-ridesharing business (“Careem Super App”). The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the second half of 2023.



Basis of Presentation:



The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC regulations regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information has been condensed or omitted and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements.



Basis of Consolidation:



The condensed consolidated financial statements include Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.



Use of Estimates:



Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions.



For more detailed information, please refer to the official filing from Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.



## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if it had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023 and will apply the guidance prospectively for future acquisitions.



In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,” which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services to disclose sufficient information about the program. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll-forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023.



## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as the amendments align with our existing policy.



### Note 2 – Revenue



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region. Revenue by geographical region is based on where the transaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors (in millions):



| |Three Months Ended June 30|Six Months Ended June 30|

|---|---|---|

|Mobility revenue|$3,553|$6,071|$4,894|$9,224|

|Delivery revenue|$2,688|$5,200|$3,057|$6,150|

|Freight revenue|$1,832|$3,656|$1,279|$2,679|

|Total revenue|$8,073|$14,927|$9,230|$18,053|



(1) We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (“Subscription”). We recognize Subscription fees ratably over the life of the pass. We allocate Subscription fees earned to Mobility and Delivery revenue on a proportional basis, based on usage for each offering during the respective period.



| |Three Months Ended June 30|Six Months Ended June 30|

|---|---|---|

|United States and Canada ("US&CAN")|$4,936|$9,498|$5,129|$10,261|

|Total revenue|$8,073|$14,927|$9,230|$18,053|



### Revenue



Mobility Revenue: We derive revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of our platform(s) and related service to facilitate and complete Mobility services and, in certain markets, revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform. Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products. Additionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

## Delivery Revenue



We derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants’ and Couriers’ use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery transactions.



During the second quarter of 2023, we implemented a business model change resulting in end-users becoming our customers. In these markets, end-users, in addition to Merchants and Couriers, are our customers.



Additionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Delivery services, Delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.



Delivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.



## Freight Revenue



Freight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.



## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation



Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of June 30, 2023, we had $119 million of contract liabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 was not material.



Our remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized as follows (in millions):

As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value. No material unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses were recorded as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining maturity of debt securities was less than one year as of June 30, 2023.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



## Fair Value Hierarchy



We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:



- Level 1: Valuations based on quoted market prices of identical underlying securities.

- Level 2: Valuations obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable or identical instruments.

- Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs and estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices and lack of liquidity.



As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, redeemable preferred stock investments, and convertible secured notes in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.



Realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities are determined using a specific identification method.

2030 Refinanced Term Loans:



In March 2023, we entered into two refinancing transactions pursuant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement. On March 3, 2023, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $1.75 billion (“First Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all outstanding 2025 Refinanced Term Loan of $1.4 billion and $317 million of the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. On March 14, 2023, we entered into the second refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $761 million (“Second Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full all outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. The Second Closing constituted an additional term loan in the same tranche as the First Closing (collectively, the “2030 Refinanced Term Loans”).



The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans have a maturity date of March 3, 2030. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans is Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 2.75% per annum, subject to a floor of 0.00%. The refinancing transactions qualified as both a debt modification and debt extinguishment. As a result, we recognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment during the six months ended June 30, 2023 in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The refinancing transactions resulted in: (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The cash inflow and cash outflow are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in our condensed statement of cash flows during six months ended June 30, 2023.



The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of June 30, 2023. The loan is secured by certain of our intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.



The fair value of our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans was $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2023 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.



During the first quarter of 2023, we identified an immaterial error related to the 2021 statement of cash flows, which omitted a $282 million cash inflow from the issuance of the 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loans and a $282 million cash outflow of principal repayment of the 2016 and 2018 Senior Secured Term Loans within cash flows from financing activities for a net impact of $0 on net cash provided by financing activities. This will be updated in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.



2025 Convertible Notes:



In December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.



## Note 9 – Income Taxes



We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $77 million and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $65 million and $120 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Zomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets and foreign tax rate differences.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, of which approximately $29 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $48 million of unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.



We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various state and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2006 through 2023 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (“UK”).



Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 30, 2023 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.



In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through June 30, 2023. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.



## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share



Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.



We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Segment Information and Geographic Information



# Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information



We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.



Our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:



|Segment|Description|

|---|---|

|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.|

|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery provides offerings for grocery, alcohol, and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. Delivery also includes advertising.|

|Freight|Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|



For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 – Revenue.



Our segment operating performance measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

## State Unemployment Taxes



In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.



The NJ DOL has initiated an audit for the period of 2021 through 2022. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain, and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023.



## California Employment Development Department



In 2014, the California Employment Development Department (“CA EDD”) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and an agreement has been reached with the CA EDD for this period. In 2022, requests for information related to an audit of a subsequent period covering the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020 were received. An audit for the years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform resulted in an assessment in June 2023. The assessment is currently being appealed, and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023.



## New York Department of Labor



In February 2020, the New York Department of Labor (“NYDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2013 through 2020. The NYDOL issued an assessment in November 2022 against Uber. An agreement in principle has been reached with the NYDOL. The amount accrued for the resolution of this matter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023.



## Non-Income Tax Matters



An estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters is recorded. Uber is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to Drivers and Couriers. The estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.



## United Kingdom



As of March 14, 2022, Uber modified its operating model in the UK. Uber UK is now a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987. An assessment from the UK Tax Authorities (“HMRC”) was received in June 2023 disputing the application of VAT Order 1987 for the period of March 2022 to March 2023 and included an assessment of £386 million (approximately $487 million) for unpaid VAT. The assessment has been paid in July 2023 to proceed with the appeals process. Uber expects to record this payment as a receivable pending a successful appeal. Additional assessments related to prior or future periods may be received, requiring further payments to continue with the appeals process.



## Brazil



In May 2023, an assessment for 2019 and 2020 Driver social security contributions was received from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Bureau (“FRB”). Uber is contesting the assessment and filed an administrative appeal with the FRB in June 2023.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Negative decisions can be appealed at multiple levels. The chances of success on the merits are still uncertain, and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.



## Other Legal and Regulatory Matters



Uber has been and continues to be subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain business practices, compliance with laws, labor laws, securities laws, data protection, privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and intellectual property rights infringement. The outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact Uber's business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.



## Indemnifications



In the ordinary course of business, Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in arrangements with third parties. The maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions cannot be determined due to unique facts and circumstances in each situation.



## Variable Interest Entities



Variable interest entities ("VIEs") are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support. Uber consolidates VIEs in which it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.



### Uber Freight Holding Corporation



Uber owns the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Uber Freight Holding Corporation. Freight Holding entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in February 2023. Uber's exposure to losses and residual returns of entities like Careem Qatar is also discussed.



### Unconsolidated VIEs



Uber does not consolidate VIEs in which it holds a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities related to unconsolidated VIEs are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial information included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.



## Overview



Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a vast network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also developing technologies to address everyday problems.



## Driver Classification Developments



Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. There are disputes over whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. In California, there have been legal actions and regulatory developments impacting driver classification, including Proposition 22. Compliance with these regulations may lead to additional expenses for Uber, but the company does not anticipate a material impact on its business operations.



If Uber is required to classify drivers as employees, it could result in significant additional expenses related to compensating drivers, applying labor laws, providing benefits, and paying taxes. This could also affect driver supply and impact Uber's business and financial performance negatively.



For more detailed information, please refer to the complete filing on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website.

### Highlights for the Second Quarter 2023



In the second quarter of 2023, our MAPCs were 137 million, growing 7 million, or 5%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 12% compared to the same period in 2022. Overall Gross Bookings increased to $33.6 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up 16% or 18% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2022. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 28% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to increases in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders. Freight Gross Bookings declined 31% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to macroeconomic headwinds impacting the broader freight industry.



Revenue was $9.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 18%, on a constant currency basis. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes.



Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $394 million, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net of $386 million primarily related to a $466 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment; a $225 million unrealized gain on our Grab investment; and a $151 million unrealized gain on our Joby investment, partially offset by a $461 million unrealized loss on our Didi investment. Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $504 million of stock-based compensation expense.

## Components of Results of Operations



### Revenue



We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. Revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants for various services. In certain markets, revenue is presented on a gross basis. Revenue may fluctuate based on various factors.



For more details on revenue, refer to the financial statements in the Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



### Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization



Cost of revenue includes insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, and costs related to services provided by Drivers and Couriers. Costs may fluctuate based on platform activity.



### Operations and Support



Expenses include compensation for employees supporting operations, customer support, and corporate costs. Expenses are expected to increase as the business grows.



### Sales and Marketing



Expenses consist of compensation costs, advertising, promotions, and discounts. Expenses may vary based on marketing campaigns and business model changes.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



# Research and Development



Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.



We would expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.



# General and Administrative



General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.



We would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.



# Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.



# Interest Expense



Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount. For additional detail related to our debt obligations, see Note 6 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.



# Other Income (Expense), Net



Other income (expense), net primarily includes various items such as interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, impairment of equity method investment, loss from sale of investment, revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, and other miscellaneous items.



# Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes



Uber is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it does business. The company maintains a valuation allowance against a majority of its deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until there is sufficient evidence to support the future utilization of these assets. The effective tax rate will vary depending on various factors including foreign to domestic income proportion, changes in valuation allowance, and tax laws.



Based on current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that Uber will have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 18 months, although the exact timing and amount of any release is unknown at this time.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.



Equity Method Investments: Equity method investments primarily include the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture prior to the sale of our remaining interest in the second quarter of 2023. For additional information, refer to Note 4 – Equity Method Investments in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

### Analysis



Adjusted EBITDA profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $916 million, showing a significant improvement of 152% from $364 million in the same period in 2022. This improvement was mainly driven by increases in Mobility and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profits, partially offset by higher Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.



For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.7 billion, marking a substantial improvement of 215% from $532 million in the same period in 2022. The improvement was primarily due to a significant increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit.

## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

## Constant Currency



We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

## Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $237 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which includes: $974 million of stock-based compensation expense; $415 million depreciation and amortization expense; $78 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets; and a $74 million loss from sale of investment, partially offset by $706 million in unrealized gains from equity securities. In addition, cash consumed by working capital decreased by $609 million. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.



Net cash provided by operating activities was $454 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $8.5 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $7.2 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $829 million of stock-based compensation expense and $497 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $631 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other accrued insurance reserves.



## Investing Activities



Net cash provided by investing activities was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.6 billion and $703 million proceeds from the sale of an equity method investment, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $2.2 billion, and $107 million in purchases of property and equipment.



Net cash used in investing activities was $189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $119 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.



## Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities was $65 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $82 million of principal payments of finance leases and a $16 million net cash outflow related to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, comprised of (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The total outflow was offset by $85 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Net cash used in financing activities was $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $108 million of principal payments on finance leases.



## Other Information



As of June 30, 2023, $2.8 billion of our $5.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of June 30, 2023, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity.

## Non-Income Tax Matters



In June 2023, Uber received an assessment from the UK Tax Authorities disputing the application of VAT Order 1987 for the period of March 2022 to March 2023. The assessment included an amount of £386 million (approximately $487 million) for unpaid VAT. In July 2023, Uber paid the assessment to proceed with the appeals process. Uber expects to record this payment as a receivable, believing that they will be successful in their appeal and the full amount will be returned with interest upon completion of the appeals process. Uber may receive additional assessments related to prior or future periods, which will require payments to continue with the appeals process. These payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow without impacting results of operations. Uber plans to vigorously defend its application of the VAT Order 1987 and is awaiting hearing dates from the Tax Tribunal.



## Commitments



Uber has non-cancelable commitments primarily related to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2023, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Uber's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, requiring the company to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates, impacting future financial statements.



## Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Refer to Note 1 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on recent accounting pronouncements.



## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



Uber is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk primarily relates to the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, with fluctuations impacting financial statements. Investment risk is managed through limiting credit exposure and maintaining high credit quality in cash deposits. Uber's investment policy aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Uber does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on Uber's financial results.



Uber is exposed to risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. Uber holds privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. Uber also holds equity securities with readily determinable fair values subject to equity price risk. These investments may increase the volatility in Uber's net income in future periods due to changes in fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of Uber's investments was $7.0 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.



## Foreign Currency Risk



Uber transacts business globally in multiple currencies. International revenue, costs, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose Uber to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect Uber's future revenue and operating results expressed in U.S. dollars. Uber's foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and expenses are incurred in the same currencies in those regions.



Uber has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities. Uber may consider entering into derivatives or other financial instruments in the future to hedge foreign currency exchange risk.



## Controls and Procedures



### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Uber maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. Management evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they are effective at a reasonable assurance level.



### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes to Uber's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect internal control over financial reporting.



Uber's management believes that disclosure controls, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives but may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud.



## Legal Proceedings



Uber is a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar actions could be brought against Uber in the future. The most significant matters are described in detail in the report.

# Legal Proceedings



Legal Proceedings Described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements



Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 12 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:



- Driver Classification

- State Unemployment Taxes



Legal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements



In addition to the matters that are identified in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.



Australia Class Actions



In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. A trial has been scheduled to commence in March 2024.



Other Legal Proceedings



While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.



## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.



### Risk Factor Summary



The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.



- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

# Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business



## Operational Risks



Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees. The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.



In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $535 million as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.



Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.



In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed. We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an

This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



## Legal Challenges and Impact on Business Model



If Uber is required to classify Drivers as employees, it would result in significant additional expenses and potential changes to the business model. This could lead to price increases for Riders and impact Driver supply and overall business operations.



### Examples of Judicial Decisions



Various judicial decisions in different countries have addressed the classification of Drivers, potentially leading to reclassification and unionization, which could further impact Uber's operations and financial condition.



## Competition in Mobility, Delivery, and Logistics Industries



The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry. Uber faces competition globally and must compete effectively to maintain its business and financial prospects.



### Global Competition and Market Fragmentation



Uber competes globally in fragmented markets with low switching costs. Competition comes from existing alternatives and potential new entrants, posing challenges to Uber's market position and differentiation.



### Impact of Competition on Offerings



Competition affects Uber's offerings in mobility, delivery, and logistics, with a focus on personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, and evolving consumer preferences. Increased competition may impact revenue, user base, and product differentiation.

The markets in which Uber competes have attracted significant investments from various sources, leading to well-capitalized competitors. This may result in competitive pressures such as price reductions, driver incentives, and promotions that could impact Uber's market position.



Uber has incurred substantial losses since inception, with operating losses of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $32.5 billion. The company anticipates the need to increase revenue and decrease expenses to achieve profitability.



Uber's future profitability is uncertain due to the need for increased revenue, cost management, and investments in various areas such as expanding markets, research and development, and marketing. The company faces challenges in balancing revenue generation with cost containment.



Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, and carrier attraction and retention are crucial for Uber's platform success. The company's ability to scale its network and liquidity in geographic markets depends on attracting and retaining these platform users.



Uber may face challenges in maintaining a balance between supply and demand in different markets, impacting service quality and overall operational effectiveness.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Below is a continuation of the content:



...



Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.



The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.



Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.



In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

# Uber Quarterly Report



We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.



We recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.



Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.



While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.



Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.



Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.



Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful.



Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.



Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.



As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,200.

Global employees as of June 30, 2023, totaled approximately 22,000, with around 19,100 located outside the United States. The company's international workforce has been growing as part of its global expansion efforts.



Properly managing growth involves hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees across various functions such as engineering, operations, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing. Any challenges in these areas could harm the business.



Implementing workforce reductions and restructurings, including responses to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, may have unintended consequences and costs. Maintaining consistent policies across regions and functions is crucial for effective management.



Failure to upgrade technology and network infrastructure could lead to system disruptions and poor user experiences. Significant resources are required to support operational growth, improve technology, and enhance financial and management systems.



The complex organizational structure of Uber, with its diverse user base and global expansion, necessitates continuous improvement in operational, financial, and management controls. Inadequate management of growth could impact platform quality and competitiveness.



Concerns about safety incidents involving platform users could affect the company's ability to attract and retain drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, impacting reputation and financial performance.



The company faces challenges in controlling and predicting user actions that may result in safety incidents, property damage, or legal liabilities. Qualification processes and background checks for platform users are important but may not uncover all relevant information.



Instances of criminal activity or misconduct by drivers, carriers, or platform users can harm the company's brand and reputation. Negative press coverage related to such incidents may impact consumer trust and business relationships.

Below is an excerpt from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):



...



Consumers in certain regions, such as Latin America, have been facing safety concerns while using or providing services on the Uber platform. Reports of violent crimes including armed robbery, assault, and rape have been increasing. These incidents not only pose risks to individuals but also impact Uber's ability to attract and retain users, potentially affecting the company's financial performance.



Public disclosure of safety incidents related to the platform, whether by Uber or third parties, could further harm the company's business and financial results.



Uber may face significant liability claims arising from accidents, injuries, or other incidents involving drivers, consumers, or third parties using the platform. Operating motor vehicles and expanding services like Delivery to include couriers on two-wheel vehicles introduce additional risks and potential liabilities.



The company's investments in new technologies and offerings, such as online grocery and alcohol delivery, carry inherent risks. While these ventures aim to drive growth, there is no guarantee of realizing expected benefits.



Uber's international operations, which account for a significant portion of its business, present challenges due to limited experience in certain markets. Managing risks associated with global expansion is crucial for the company's financial performance and future prospects.

We do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:



- Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

- The resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation

of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;

- Laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet

activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,

payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and

background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,

ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;

- Competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing

relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;

- Differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;

- Differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;

- Exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;

- Legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a

lack of clear legal precedent;

- Difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor

unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;

- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

- Managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;

- Regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the

same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;

- Adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of

earnings;

- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;

- Difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and

jurisdictions;

- Import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;

- Political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in

general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;

- Public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to

time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate;

- Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.



These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.



We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.



Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with

and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy

has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our

competitors in those lines of businesses.

As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, Lime, and Aurora. Our ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of Didi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate. Any material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. Further, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily related to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.



We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:



- grow supply and demand on our platform;

- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;

- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;

- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;

- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;

- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;

- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;

- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;

- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;

- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;

- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and

- increase positive perception of our brand.



We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability.



We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.



In 2022, we derived 22% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.



Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s business, financial condition, and operating results for a specific quarter.



In 2022, Uber generated 15% of its Mobility Gross Bookings from trips related to airports, making its operating results susceptible to regulations impacting drivers' ability to provide airport trips.



Concerns include declines in air travel affecting demand for airport-related Mobility, regulatory challenges at airports, and potential fines or sanctions for non-compliance.



Uber's investment in autonomous vehicle technologies is crucial for future competitiveness. Collaborations with companies like Aurora aim to launch self-driving vehicles on the ridesharing network.



Risks associated with autonomous vehicle technologies include collisions, liabilities, regulatory challenges, and competition from other companies developing similar technologies.



Uber's success also relies on retaining high-quality personnel, with attrition or unsuccessful succession planning posing risks to the business.

Competitor Challenges and Workplace Practices:



Uber faces challenges related to historical culture, workplace practices, and negative publicity leading to significant attrition and difficulty in attracting high-quality employees. The shift to a hybrid work model may pose challenges in maintaining corporate culture, productivity, and employee availability.



Leadership Transitions and Management Changes:



Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt Uber's business, potentially leading to senior management turnover. Failure to have adequate succession plans or key employees transitioning into new roles could harm operating results and growth.



Key Personnel and Talent Retention:



Uber relies on key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The loss of key executives or failure to attract high-quality talent could impact operating results. Equity incentives are used to attract and retain personnel, but may not always align with business interests.



Data Security and Privacy:



Uber collects and processes personal data, making it a target for security breaches. Unauthorized access to data could result in revenue loss, brand harm, and liabilities. Third-party service providers hosting data may also experience security incidents, impacting Uber.



Security Breaches and Liability:



Uber faces risks of security breaches, computer viruses, and cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, damage business, and lead to liabilities. Compliance with laws and regulations, litigation, and governmental investigations are additional concerns.



Previous Incidents:



Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as a cybersecurity incident in September 2022 and a data security incident in May 2014, highlighting the ongoing risks the company faces.

Actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) announced a final order relating to the data security incident. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if Drizly or we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Security and privacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional regulatory scrutiny.



Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.



We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks. Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.



To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.



Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.



We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational

In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.



Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. In 2022, 72% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.



Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.



Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment. Our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information, which can create discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms may use third-party AI with unclear intellectual property rights or interests.

## Climate Change Risks



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks. These risks involve market shifts towards electric vehicles, extreme weather events, and emerging climate policies.



Uber has made climate-related commitments such as transitioning to 100% renewable electricity for U.S. offices by 2025 and achieving net zero climate emissions by 2030.



External factors like changing regulations, technology advancements, and EV availability impact Uber's ability to meet its climate commitments.



## General Economic Risks



Uber acknowledges the impact of catastrophic events like disease outbreaks, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks on its business and financial condition.



The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected Uber's operations, leading to reduced demand for mobility offerings and impacting driver supply constraints.



Future impacts of pandemics or disease outbreaks on Uber's business will depend on various factors including vaccine efficacy, global developments, and regulatory orders.

Changes to our end-users’ behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, we cannot predict the impact any future pandemic or outbreak of a disease, or a catastrophic event will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations. The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results. Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity. Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results. Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may continue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.

# Dependencies on Third Parties



The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.



## Internet and Mobile Infrastructure



Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals, or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide necessary bandwidth, can interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. This may lead to decreased user engagement and potential revenue loss.



## Mobile Communications Systems



Unanticipated problems like power outages, security breaches, or telecommunications failures can cause delays or interruptions to our products and offerings. Government actions to shut down services could also impact our operations and reputation.



## Third-Party Marketplaces and Software



We rely on open marketplaces like the Apple App Store and Google Play for distributing our platform and using essential software like Google Maps. Changes in marketplace structures or fees, or disruptions in software access, could adversely affect our business.



## Interoperability



Our platform's interoperability across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications is crucial. Loss of interoperability could have negative implications for our business, especially if we cannot adapt to evolving third-party services.



## Payment Processing Infrastructure



Third-party elements in our payment processing infrastructure are essential for remitting payments to drivers and merchants. If these elements become unavailable or come with unfavorable terms, our business could face disruptions and increased costs.

## Risks and Challenges



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces several risks and challenges that could impact its business operations:



### Increased Costs and System Failures



The company may experience increased costs due to rising fees, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. System failures have also caused payment delays to drivers, leading to dissatisfaction and complaints.



### Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers



Uber relies on third-party service providers for hosting its platform. Any interruptions or delays in services from these providers could harm the delivery of products and offerings.



### Data Security and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities



The company uses a combination of cloud computing services and data centers, which may be vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters, or other disruptions. Any data loss or interruption in services could impact the company's reputation and brand.



### Open Source Software Risks



Uber's use of third-party open source software exposes it to possible litigation and compliance challenges. Non-compliance with open source licenses could result in the release of proprietary source code or the need for software re-engineering.



These risks and challenges highlight the potential impact on Uber's business operations and financial performance.

Source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.



## Financing and Transactional Risks



We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.



We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As of June 30, 2023, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.3 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $153 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of June 30, 2023. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations. In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed

to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters

are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject

to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play

payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.



Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for

valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.



As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.1 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $9.4 billion that started expiring in 2022 and $2.0 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $633 million that begin to expire in 2023 and $17.7 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.



We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.



Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.



If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.



As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.



Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.



In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or AI risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:



- diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;

- disrupting our ongoing business operations;

- platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;

- implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;

- integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting.

Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.



In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability, discrimination, safety, and employment.

This document contains information about potential risks and legal proceedings that Uber Technologies, Inc. may face, as disclosed in their quarterly report.



## Legal Proceedings and Compliance Risks



Uber Technologies, Inc. is exposed to various legal proceedings, including actions by drivers, consumers, merchants, and government agencies. Adverse outcomes in litigation could result in monetary damages or operational limitations.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.



Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.



We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.



Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.



We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.



In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.



We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.



In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business

Customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.



We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.



If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Intellectual Property Risks



Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, divert management's attention and resources, and harm goodwill associated with our brand. Adverse outcomes may lead to significant liability, cessation of technology use, and hindered competitiveness.



# Financial Reporting Risks



Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our reported financial results. Evolving business models, regulations, and interpretations could impact revenue recognition, leading to material changes in financial statements and reporting processes.



# Investment Company Act Compliance



If deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may face restrictions affecting our business. Compliance requirements and limitations on activities could impact our financial condition and operations, necessitating asset sales and tax payments.



# Common Stock Ownership Risks



The market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline steeply, irrespective of operating performance. Factors beyond our control, such as financial results, analyst expectations, and industry announcements, can significantly influence stock price.

As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value. No material unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses were recorded as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining maturity of debt securities was less than one year as of June 30, 2023.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.



## Fair Value Hierarchy



We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:



- Level 1: Valuations based on quoted market prices of identical underlying securities.

- Level 2: Valuations obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable or identical instruments.

- Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs and estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices and lack of liquidity.



As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, redeemable preferred stock investments, and convertible secured notes in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.



Realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities are determined using a specific identification method.

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.





We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $77 million and $(155) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $65 million and $120 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily driven by the current tax on our foreign earnings, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Zomato, and Grab. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, Didi, and Zomato, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets and foreign tax rate differences.



During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $77 million, of which approximately $29 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $48 million of unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.





Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 30, 2023 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.







Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.



We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

## Non-Income Tax Matters



An estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters is recorded. Uber is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to Drivers and Couriers. The estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.

## Indemnifications



In the ordinary course of business, Uber includes standard indemnification provisions in arrangements with third parties. The maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions cannot be determined due to unique facts and circumstances in each situation.



## Variable Interest Entities



Variable interest entities ("VIEs") are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support. Uber consolidates VIEs in which it holds a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.



### Uber Freight Holding Corporation

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.



## Overview



Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a vast network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also developing technologies to address everyday problems.



## Driver Classification Developments



Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. There are disputes over whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. In California, there have been legal actions and regulatory developments impacting driver classification, including Proposition 22. Compliance with these regulations may lead to additional expenses for Uber, but the company does not anticipate a material impact on its business operations.



If Uber is required to classify drivers as employees, it could result in significant additional expenses related to compensating drivers, applying labor laws, providing benefits, and paying taxes. This could also affect driver supply and impact Uber's business and financial performance negatively.

### Highlights for the Second Quarter 2023



In the second quarter of 2023, our MAPCs were 137 million, growing 7 million, or 5%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 12% compared to the same period in 2022. Overall Gross Bookings increased to $33.6 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up 16% or 18% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2022. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 28% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to increases in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders. Freight Gross Bookings declined 31% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to macroeconomic headwinds impacting the broader freight industry.



Revenue was $9.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 18%, on a constant currency basis. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes.



Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $394 million, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net of $386 million primarily related to a $466 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment; a $225 million unrealized gain on our Grab investment; and a $151 million unrealized gain on our Joby investment, partially offset by a $461 million unrealized loss on our Didi investment. Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $504 million of stock-based compensation expense.

## Components of Results of Operations



### Revenue



We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. Revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants for various services. In certain markets, revenue is presented on a gross basis. Revenue may fluctuate based on various factors.



For more details on revenue, refer to the financial statements in the Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



### Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization



Cost of revenue includes insurance costs, credit card processing fees, data center expenses, and costs related to services provided by Drivers and Couriers. Costs may fluctuate based on platform activity.



### Operations and Support



Expenses include compensation for employees supporting operations, customer support, and corporate costs. Expenses are expected to increase as the business grows.



### Sales and Marketing



Expenses consist of compensation costs, advertising, promotions, and discounts. Expenses may vary based on marketing campaigns and business model changes.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



# Research and Development



Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.



We would expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.



# General and Administrative



General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.



We would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.



# Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.



# Interest Expense





# Other Income (Expense), Net



Other income (expense), net primarily includes various items such as interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, impairment of equity method investment, loss from sale of investment, revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, and other miscellaneous items.



# Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes



Uber is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it does business. The company maintains a valuation allowance against a majority of its deferred tax assets and will continue to do so until there is sufficient evidence to support the future utilization of these assets. The effective tax rate will vary depending on various factors including foreign to domestic income proportion, changes in valuation allowance, and tax laws.



Based on current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that Uber will have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 18 months, although the exact timing and amount of any release is unknown at this time.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

### Analysis



Adjusted EBITDA profit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $916 million, showing a significant improvement of 152% from $364 million in the same period in 2022. This improvement was mainly driven by increases in Mobility and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profits, partially offset by higher Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.



For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.7 billion, marking a substantial improvement of 215% from $532 million in the same period in 2022. The improvement was primarily due to a significant increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit.

## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

## Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $237 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which includes: $974 million of stock-based compensation expense; $415 million depreciation and amortization expense; $78 million in impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and other assets; and a $74 million loss from sale of investment, partially offset by $706 million in unrealized gains from equity securities. In addition, cash consumed by working capital decreased by $609 million. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.



Net cash provided by operating activities was $454 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $8.5 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $7.2 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $829 million of stock-based compensation expense and $497 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $631 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other accrued insurance reserves.



## Investing Activities



Net cash provided by investing activities was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.6 billion and $703 million proceeds from the sale of an equity method investment, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $2.2 billion, and $107 million in purchases of property and equipment.



Net cash used in investing activities was $189 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $119 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.



## Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities was $65 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $82 million of principal payments of finance leases and a $16 million net cash outflow related to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, comprised of (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The total outflow was offset by $85 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Net cash used in financing activities was $108 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily consisting of $108 million of principal payments on finance leases.

## Non-Income Tax Matters





## Commitments



Uber has non-cancelable commitments primarily related to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2023, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.



## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Uber's financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, requiring the company to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and other reasonable assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates, impacting future financial statements.



## Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Refer to Note 1 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details on recent accounting pronouncements.



## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



Uber is exposed to market risks including interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk primarily relates to the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, with fluctuations impacting financial statements. Investment risk is managed through limiting credit exposure and maintaining high credit quality in cash deposits. Uber's investment policy aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.

---

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



Securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Uber does not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on Uber's financial results.



Uber is exposed to risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. Uber holds privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. Uber also holds equity securities with readily determinable fair values subject to equity price risk. These investments may increase the volatility in Uber's net income in future periods due to changes in fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of Uber's investments was $7.0 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.



## Foreign Currency Risk



Uber transacts business globally in multiple currencies. International revenue, costs, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose Uber to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect Uber's future revenue and operating results expressed in U.S. dollars. Uber's foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and expenses are incurred in the same currencies in those regions.



Uber has experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities. Uber may consider entering into derivatives or other financial instruments in the future to hedge foreign currency exchange risk.



## Controls and Procedures



### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Uber maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within specified time periods. Management evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they are effective at a reasonable assurance level.



### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes to Uber's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect internal control over financial reporting.



Uber's management believes that disclosure controls, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives but may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud.



## Legal Proceedings



Uber is a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar actions could be brought against Uber in the future. The most significant matters are described in detail in the report.

Australia Class Actions



In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. A trial has been scheduled to commence in March 2024.



Other Legal Proceedings



While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.



## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS





### Risk Factor Summary



The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.



- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

# Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business



## Operational Risks





In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $535 million as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.

This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



## Legal Challenges and Impact on Business Model



If Uber is required to classify Drivers as employees, it would result in significant additional expenses and potential changes to the business model. This could lead to price increases for Riders and impact Driver supply and overall business operations.



### Examples of Judicial Decisions



Various judicial decisions in different countries have addressed the classification of Drivers, potentially leading to reclassification and unionization, which could further impact Uber's operations and financial condition.



## Competition in Mobility, Delivery, and Logistics Industries



The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive with low barriers to entry. Uber faces competition globally and must compete effectively to maintain its business and financial prospects.



### Global Competition and Market Fragmentation



Uber competes globally in fragmented markets with low switching costs. Competition comes from existing alternatives and potential new entrants, posing challenges to Uber's market position and differentiation.



### Impact of Competition on Offerings



Competition affects Uber's offerings in mobility, delivery, and logistics, with a focus on personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, and evolving consumer preferences. Increased competition may impact revenue, user base, and product differentiation.

The markets in which Uber competes have attracted significant investments from various sources, leading to well-capitalized competitors. This may result in competitive pressures such as price reductions, driver incentives, and promotions that could impact Uber's market position.



Uber has incurred substantial losses since inception, with operating losses of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $32.5 billion. The company anticipates the need to increase revenue and decrease expenses to achieve profitability.



Uber's future profitability is uncertain due to the need for increased revenue, cost management, and investments in various areas such as expanding markets, research and development, and marketing. The company faces challenges in balancing revenue generation with cost containment.



Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, and carrier attraction and retention are crucial for Uber's platform success. The company's ability to scale its network and liquidity in geographic markets depends on attracting and retaining these platform users.



Uber may face challenges in maintaining a balance between supply and demand in different markets, impacting service quality and overall operational effectiveness.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report



This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Below is a continuation of the content:



...



Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.



The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.



Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.



In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.



Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.



...

---

# Uber Quarterly Report



# Uber Quarterly Report



We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.



We recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.



Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.



While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.



Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.





Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful.



Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.



Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.



As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,200.

Global employees as of June 30, 2023, totaled approximately 22,000, with around 19,100 located outside the United States. The company's international workforce has been growing as part of its global expansion efforts.



Properly managing growth involves hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees across various functions such as engineering, operations, finance, accounting, sales, and marketing. Any challenges in these areas could harm the business.



Implementing workforce reductions and restructurings, including responses to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, may have unintended consequences and costs. Maintaining consistent policies across regions and functions is crucial for effective management.



Failure to upgrade technology and network infrastructure could lead to system disruptions and poor user experiences. Significant resources are required to support operational growth, improve technology, and enhance financial and management systems.



The complex organizational structure of Uber, with its diverse user base and global expansion, necessitates continuous improvement in operational, financial, and management controls. Inadequate management of growth could impact platform quality and competitiveness.



Concerns about safety incidents involving platform users could affect the company's ability to attract and retain drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, impacting reputation and financial performance.



The company faces challenges in controlling and predicting user actions that may result in safety incidents, property damage, or legal liabilities. Qualification processes and background checks for platform users are important but may not uncover all relevant information.



Instances of criminal activity or misconduct by drivers, carriers, or platform users can harm the company's brand and reputation. Negative press coverage related to such incidents may impact consumer trust and business relationships.

Below is an excerpt from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):



...



Consumers in certain regions, such as Latin America, have been facing safety concerns while using or providing services on the Uber platform. Reports of violent crimes including armed robbery, assault, and rape have been increasing. These incidents not only pose risks to individuals but also impact Uber's ability to attract and retain users, potentially affecting the company's financial performance.



Public disclosure of safety incidents related to the platform, whether by Uber or third parties, could further harm the company's business and financial results.



Uber may face significant liability claims arising from accidents, injuries, or other incidents involving drivers, consumers, or third parties using the platform. Operating motor vehicles and expanding services like Delivery to include couriers on two-wheel vehicles introduce additional risks and potential liabilities.



The company's investments in new technologies and offerings, such as online grocery and alcohol delivery, carry inherent risks. While these ventures aim to drive growth, there is no guarantee of realizing expected benefits.



Uber's international operations, which account for a significant portion of its business, present challenges due to limited experience in certain markets. Managing risks associated with global expansion is crucial for the company's financial performance and future prospects.

We do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:



- Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

- The resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation

of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;

- Laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet

activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,

payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and

background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,

ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;

- Competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing

relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;

- Differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;

- Differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;

- Exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;

- Legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a

lack of clear legal precedent;

- Difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor

unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;

- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

- Managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;

- Regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the

same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;

- Adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of

earnings;

- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;

- Difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and

jurisdictions;

- Import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;

- Political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in

general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;

- Public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to

time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate;

- Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.



These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.



We have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.



Our growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with

and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy

has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our

competitors in those lines of businesses.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.



We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:



- grow supply and demand on our platform;

- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;

- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;

- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;

- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;

- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;

- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;

- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;

- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;

- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and

- increase positive perception of our brand.



We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability.



We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.





Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s business, financial condition, and operating results for a specific quarter.



In 2022, Uber generated 15% of its Mobility Gross Bookings from trips related to airports, making its operating results susceptible to regulations impacting drivers' ability to provide airport trips.



Concerns include declines in air travel affecting demand for airport-related Mobility, regulatory challenges at airports, and potential fines or sanctions for non-compliance.



Uber's investment in autonomous vehicle technologies is crucial for future competitiveness. Collaborations with companies like Aurora aim to launch self-driving vehicles on the ridesharing network.



Risks associated with autonomous vehicle technologies include collisions, liabilities, regulatory challenges, and competition from other companies developing similar technologies.



Uber's success also relies on retaining high-quality personnel, with attrition or unsuccessful succession planning posing risks to the business.

Competitor Challenges and Workplace Practices:



Uber faces challenges related to historical culture, workplace practices, and negative publicity leading to significant attrition and difficulty in attracting high-quality employees. The shift to a hybrid work model may pose challenges in maintaining corporate culture, productivity, and employee availability.



Leadership Transitions and Management Changes:



Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt Uber's business, potentially leading to senior management turnover. Failure to have adequate succession plans or key employees transitioning into new roles could harm operating results and growth.



Key Personnel and Talent Retention:



Uber relies on key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The loss of key executives or failure to attract high-quality talent could impact operating results. Equity incentives are used to attract and retain personnel, but may not always align with business interests.



Data Security and Privacy:



Uber collects and processes personal data, making it a target for security breaches. Unauthorized access to data could result in revenue loss, brand harm, and liabilities. Third-party service providers hosting data may also experience security incidents, impacting Uber.



Security Breaches and Liability:



Uber faces risks of security breaches, computer viruses, and cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, damage business, and lead to liabilities. Compliance with laws and regulations, litigation, and governmental investigations are additional concerns.



Previous Incidents:



Uber has experienced security and privacy incidents in the past, such as a cybersecurity incident in September 2022 and a data security incident in May 2014, highlighting the ongoing risks the company faces.

Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.



We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks. Various other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.



To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.



Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.



We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational

In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.





Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

## Climate Change Risks



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks. These risks involve market shifts towards electric vehicles, extreme weather events, and emerging climate policies.



Uber has made climate-related commitments such as transitioning to 100% renewable electricity for U.S. offices by 2025 and achieving net zero climate emissions by 2030.



External factors like changing regulations, technology advancements, and EV availability impact Uber's ability to meet its climate commitments.



## General Economic Risks



Uber acknowledges the impact of catastrophic events like disease outbreaks, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks on its business and financial condition.



The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected Uber's operations, leading to reduced demand for mobility offerings and impacting driver supply constraints.



Future impacts of pandemics or disease outbreaks on Uber's business will depend on various factors including vaccine efficacy, global developments, and regulatory orders.

# Dependencies on Third Parties



The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.



## Internet and Mobile Infrastructure



Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals, or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide necessary bandwidth, can interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. This may lead to decreased user engagement and potential revenue loss.



## Mobile Communications Systems



Unanticipated problems like power outages, security breaches, or telecommunications failures can cause delays or interruptions to our products and offerings. Government actions to shut down services could also impact our operations and reputation.



## Third-Party Marketplaces and Software



We rely on open marketplaces like the Apple App Store and Google Play for distributing our platform and using essential software like Google Maps. Changes in marketplace structures or fees, or disruptions in software access, could adversely affect our business.



## Interoperability



Our platform's interoperability across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications is crucial. Loss of interoperability could have negative implications for our business, especially if we cannot adapt to evolving third-party services.



## Payment Processing Infrastructure



Third-party elements in our payment processing infrastructure are essential for remitting payments to drivers and merchants. If these elements become unavailable or come with unfavorable terms, our business could face disruptions and increased costs.

## Risks and Challenges



Uber Technologies, Inc. faces several risks and challenges that could impact its business operations:



### Increased Costs and System Failures



The company may experience increased costs due to rising fees, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. System failures have also caused payment delays to drivers, leading to dissatisfaction and complaints.



### Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers



Uber relies on third-party service providers for hosting its platform. Any interruptions or delays in services from these providers could harm the delivery of products and offerings.



### Data Security and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities



The company uses a combination of cloud computing services and data centers, which may be vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters, or other disruptions. Any data loss or interruption in services could impact the company's reputation and brand.



### Open Source Software Risks



Uber's use of third-party open source software exposes it to possible litigation and compliance challenges. Non-compliance with open source licenses could result in the release of proprietary source code or the need for software re-engineering.



These risks and challenges highlight the potential impact on Uber's business operations and financial performance.

Source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.



## Financing and Transactional Risks



We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.



We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As of June 30, 2023, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.3 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $153 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of June 30, 2023. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations. In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive

Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed

to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters

to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play

payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.



Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for

valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.





We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.



Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.



If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.



As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.

Uber faces legal and regulatory risks in various jurisdictions, including potential fines, regulatory obstacles, and compliance challenges. These risks could impact business growth and financial performance.



## Global Operations



Uber operates in approximately 10,500 cities across 70 countries, subject to differing laws and regulations. Proposed regulations may harm business operations and financial results.



## Impact of Laws and Regulations



New laws and regulations could lead to liability, compliance costs, and restrictions on Uber's operations. Expansion into new areas like medical transportation may bring additional regulatory challenges.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.



Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.



We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.



Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.





In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.



We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.



In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business

Customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.



We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.



If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report



# Intellectual Property Risks



Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, divert management's attention and resources, and harm goodwill associated with our brand. Adverse outcomes may lead to significant liability, cessation of technology use, and hindered competitiveness.



# Financial Reporting Risks



Changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our reported financial results. Evolving business models, regulations, and interpretations could impact revenue recognition, leading to material changes in financial statements and reporting processes.



# Investment Company Act Compliance



If deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may face restrictions affecting our business. Compliance requirements and limitations on activities could impact our financial condition and operations, necessitating asset sales and tax payments.



# Common Stock Ownership Risks



The market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline steeply, irrespective of operating performance. Factors beyond our control, such as financial results, analyst expectations, and industry announcements, can significantly influence stock price.
